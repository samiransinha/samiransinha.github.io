My research focuses on statistical methods for epidemiological studies, which explore factors influencing the health and illness of populations. These studies provide the groundwork for interventions in public health and preventive medicine. Specifically, my research aims to develop innovative statistical techniques to address measurement errors in key variables and to handle cases with partially missing data. The statistical methods I develop employ parametric, semiparametric, and nonparametric approaches, enabling flexible and robust modeling.

Currently, I am engaged in projects involving efficient computation, feature selection, high-dimensional data, and survey methods. If you are interested in collaborating in these areas, please feel free to email me.
