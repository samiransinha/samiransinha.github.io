Howdy! I am Wesley Fletcher, a class of '26 Aggie from Houston, Texas. I decided to pursue statistics following taking an introductory course in high school. Since arriving at A&M, I have served as a teacher's assistant to Dr. Kyle Thicke within the Department of Mathematics and am a textbook editor under Dr. Phillip Yasskin. I am currently working as an Undergraduate Student Researcher under Dr. Sinha and plan to pursue a Master's Degree in Statistics at A&M.
