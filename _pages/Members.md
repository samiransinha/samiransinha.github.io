Howdy! I am Wesley Fletcher, a class of '26 Aggie from Houston, Texas. I decided to pursue statistics following taking an introductory course in high school. Since arriving at A&M, I have served as a teacher's assistant to Dr. Kyle Thicke within the Department of Mathematics and am a textbook editor under Dr. Phillip Yasskin. I am currently working as an Undergraduate Student Researcher under Dr. Sinha and plan to pursue a Master's Degree in Statistics at A&M.

Hello, my name is Zane Ali, and I am currently a junior majoring in statistics with a minor in business at Texas A&M University. I am actively engaged in research as a paid undergraduate researcher under the mentorship of Dr. Sinha, where my focus lies in conducting statistical analysis of gene expression data of cancer patients. This opportunity has allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge gained from my coursework in a practical setting, deepening my understanding of statistical methods and their applications in healthcare and biological research.

Looking ahead, I am enthusiastic about continuing my academic journey at Texas A&M by pursuing a master's degree in statistics. This decision stems from my passion for exploring advanced statistical techniques and their role in other fields.
