Howdy! I’m Weiyi Huang and currently a Biostatistics master student at Texas A&M University. I’ve been working as a research assistant under Dr. Sinha, conducting research on birth defects and biological clocks. This experience has enabled me to apply statistical methods to scientific research across health-related fields such as medicine, biology, and epidemiology, as well as to develop new tools for studying these areas. I’ll further pursue a Ph.D. degree in biostatistics to study advanced statistical methods for exploring and understanding the world.

Hello! I am Yuting Jia, currently a master’s student in Statistics at Texas A&M University. I hold a Bachelor of Mathematics in Statistics from Carleton University. My main focus is on applying statistical methods to healthcare data. I have skills in data analytics, visualization, and predictive modeling, with proficiency in R, Python, SAS, SQL, and Tableau.

During my undergraduate studies, I worked on various projects involving healthcare data management and marketing analytics, developing and maintaining databases. Currently, under the research guidance of Dr. Sinha, I am further developing my expertise in healthcare data analysis. After completing my degree, I aspire to work in the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries, leveraging big data and robust statistical methods to improve patient outcomes and healthcare interventions.

Hello, my name is Zane Ali, and I am currently a junior majoring in statistics with a minor in business at Texas A&M University. I am actively engaged in research as a paid undergraduate researcher under the mentorship of Dr. Sinha, where my focus lies in conducting statistical analysis of gene expression data of cancer patients. This opportunity has allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge gained from my coursework in a practical setting, deepening my understanding of statistical methods and their applications in healthcare and biological research.

Looking ahead, I am enthusiastic about continuing my academic journey at Texas A&M by pursuing a master's degree in statistics. This decision stems from my passion for exploring advanced statistical techniques and their role in other fields.
